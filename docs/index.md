After cloning the starter code with GitHub Desktop, you're ready to start building the first prototype.

In this lesson we will learn how to control player movement by building a simple driving simulator. You will choose and position a vehicle for the player to drive and add obstacles for them to hit or avoid. You will also postition the camera for the player to see through, establishing their point-of-view for the scene. Through this process, you will learn to navigate the Unity Editor and grow comfortable moving around in 3D Space. Lastly, you will see how to customize your window layout in the Unity Editor.
